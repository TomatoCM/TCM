/**
 * A Bowl is a generic container/context/workspace concept. Different plugin implementations may implement this for
 * additional features.
 * <p>
 * Bowls provide access to various "Manager" classes that in turn provide access to specific types of stored objects
 * that may be specificially grouped in the Bowl. As much as possible, Managers should generally not depend on
 * Bowl-specific features *except* common underlying storage mechanisms that are defined as APIs on Bowl itself (this
 * interface). For example, ConnectionManager does not directly depend on Bowl-specific attributes, except for the
 * MetaStore.
 * <p>
 * Specific subclasses for contexts should implement their custom logic to get a MetaStore or other underlying storage,
 * and the managers should just build on that and not have any other Bowl-specific code.
 * <p>
 * All implementations of Bowl should implement equals() and hashcode().
