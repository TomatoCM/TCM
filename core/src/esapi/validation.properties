# The ESAPI validator does many security checks on input, such as canonicalization
# and whitelist validation. Note that all of these validation rules are applied *after*
# canonicalization. Double-encoded characters (even with different encodings involved,
# are never allowed.
#
# To use:
#
# First set up a pattern below. You can choose any name you want, prefixed by the word
# "Validation." For example:
#   Validation.Email=^[A-Za-z0-9._%-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$
# 
# Then you can validate in your code against the pattern like this:
#   Validator.getInstance().getValidDataFromBrowser( "Email", input );
#   Validator.getInstance().isValidDataFromBrowser( "Email", input );
#
